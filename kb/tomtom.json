Here’s a sneak preview of what TomTom will show at the world’s biggest technology expo this January.\n\nVisitors to TomTom’s booth at CES 2025 in the Las Vegas Convention Center will be able to see and experience a full suite of products, divided into four specialized areas. These are Driver Experience, Future of Driving, Orbis Maps and an enterprise area. While maps remain at the heart of what TomTom does, these four zones will invite visitors to explore the expansive used cases of TomTom’s maps offerings, from electric vehicle (EV) navigation to the systems that will power tomorrow’s self-driving vehicles.\n\nTomTom can be found in the West Hall at Booth W311-312, from 10am on Tuesday, January 7, 2025 to 6pm on Thursday, January 9, 2025.\n\nDriving a better experience\nWhat are the expectations of today’s driver, and how can we meet them? The Driver Experience section of TomTom’s CES exhibit will showcase how the mapmaker is answering this question, bringing together all the elements a driver needs to make for a seamless, frictionless driver experience.\n\nWhile these elements, from the car’s stereo to its hazard warnings, once sat separately, today’s driver wants to feel in control of the entire system, and it must be smooth to operate.“We have called this the unified driving experience,” explains Andy Marchant, TomTom Director of Product Marketing. “It includes navigation, which is still a key driver component, and includes EVs, because navigation is also important for EV drivers.\n\nThey need to create a route which takes into account range and charging options.” The unified system includes Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), which give drivers the information and warnings they need to drive safely and smoothly.\n\nhttps://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/product-focus/ces-2025-demos-sneak-peek/","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/product-focus/ces-2025-demos-sneak-peek/","created_at":"2024/12/27 13:43:55 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/3126199908147201"},{"message_id":"2815021498523649","sender_name":"Mario Van den Broek","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"Inside TomTom’s EV vision: What’s a mapmaker got to do with electric vehicles?\nIn a world rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs), one might wonder what a mapmaker like TomTom has to do with this transformative shift. The answer, as it turns out, is quite profound. As we embrace the EV revolution, we are faced with the challenge of simplifying and streamlining the experience of living with and using electric vehicles, making it as effortless as possible. This is where TomTom steps in with its innovative approach to mapping.\n\nTraditionally, industries in the automotive world have functioned in separate silos, with carmakers, filling stations, and other stakeholders working independently. However, for EVs to truly thrive, collaboration is key. TomTom's Senior EV Product Manager, Drew Meehan, emphasizes the need for these entities to learn and work together. This collaborative effort is crucial for the successful adoption of EVs.\n\nThe world of EVs comprises three main elements: EV makers, charging infrastructure providers, and mapmakers. TomTom, as a mapmaker, plays a pivotal role in connecting these traditionally isolated industries. The company's expertise lies in providing access to maps and location technology that can address the universal challenges associated with electric cars, vans, and trucks. This includes finding compatible charging stations, planning efficient routes, and optimizing charging schedules.\n\nThe challenges of transitioning to EVs are not limited to individual drivers; they extend to fleet managers and EV charging firms as well. Whether it's maximizing range, finding charging locations, or ensuring compatibility, the fundamental challenges are the same. TomTom's efforts aim to benefit everyone involved in the EV ecosystem by making the experience more convenient, efficient, and stress-free.\n\nTo realize this vision, TomTom emphasizes the importance of connectivity and data. By seamlessly integrating in-vehicle systems with real-time information about charging points, EV-specific routing algorithms, and constantly updated data about charging infrastructure and traffic, TomTom aims to provide a comprehensive solution. The goal is to make EVs easy to live with, with the technology seamlessly integrated into the background, much like the trusted navigation systems we use today.\n\nIn essence, TomTom's role in the EV revolution is about creating a connected ecosystem that bridges the gap between carmakers, charging infrastructure providers, and EV users. This synergy between data, maps, location technology, and collaboration can pave the way for a more accessible and enjoyable EV experience. As the world accelerates towards electric mobility, TomTom's mapmaking capabilities hold the key to simplifying the journey and making it as smooth as possible. https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/whats-a-mapmaker-got-to-do-with-evs/","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/whats-a-mapmaker-got-to-do-with-evs/","created_at":"2023/10/02 09:18:06 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2470735070437377"},{"message_id":"2319982835867649","sender_name":"Iman Zalinyan","group_name":"6.2.

The agreement will support new Alteryx cloud-based analytics offerings, such as Alteryx Location Intelligence, which premiered at the Alteryx Inspire user conference.\n\nTogether, TomTom and Alteryx collaborate to integrate TomTom’s Maps APIs into Alteryx products and location insights packages, such as Alteryx Designer and the newly launched Location Intelligence offering on the Alteryx Analytics Cloud Platform. The Alteryx Analytics Cloud democratizes analytics by allowing all users to participate in the analytics and decision intelligence process regardless of job role, skill level, or department. Location Intelligence makes it easy to create location insights with its easy-to-use map-based interface and easy-to-understand analysis tasks. Through this integration, TomTom adds real-world context to support sharper competitor analysis, site selection, and many other types of analysis within Alteryx analytics tools.\n\n“Partnerships with leaders like Alteryx are prime examples of how we deliver sophisticated location technology across a broad array of use cases, and we’re proud to build on our decade of collaboration to help Alteryx drive even more innovation through this new solution,” said Ramachandra Kalaga, Vice President of Product Management, TomTom. “Location technology is a team sport, and we’re excited to power Alteryx’s offerings with our Maps APIs to enable better, smarter, and faster decision-making.”\n\n“TomTom is a reliable, innovative, and collaborative partner, and we’re thrilled to deepen our relationship with the launch of Location Intelligence,” said Jeffrey Van Rees, Geospatial Product Manager, Alteryx. “The company’s maps data continues to support Alteryx as we expand our cloud-connected platform experiences and deliver the intelligence our customers need to solve today’s problems and anticipate future demands.”\n\nUnlocking Spatial Insights with Alteryx and TomTom\nAlteryx uses TomTom’s location data and Maps APIs to incorporate spatial data into its analytics tools. Integrated TomTom data amplifies analysis by adding more than 50 layers of cartographic data, such as roads, waterways, parks, and more. By spatially enriching data in this way, Alteryx users can apply more advanced analytical techniques such as geocoding and drivetime analysis for better decision-making.\n\nA retailer, for example, could use this added level of insight to determine the optimal location for a new grocery store. Using data on existing store locations and customer transactions, analysts can map out the information to see how well existing stores are positioned relative to each other and target customers. This spatial analysis could potentially reveal a gap in the retailer’s geographical coverage or identify underserved areas. Similarly, a telecoms operator could use map data to map which areas have the best natural features to support cellular network optimization.\n\nBy unlocking spatial insights such as these, Alteryx helps clients obtain a more complete and profitable understanding of local transactions, regional markets, and network investments to improve the outcome of critical decisions.\n\n“With TomTom data enriching Alteryx analytics tools, decision makers can uncover new opportunities in their data and make confident choices that translate into improved business outcomes and a greater competitive advantage,” Kalaga added. https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/press-releases/general/311829351/tomtom-and-alteryx-deepen-partnership-with-new-location-intelligence-offering/","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/press-releases/general/311829351/tomtom-and-alteryx-deepen-partnership-with-new-location-intelligence-offering/","created_at":"2023/06/20 09:19:12 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2319982835867649"},{"message_id":"2121333466718209","sender_name":"Hendrik Bastiaans","group_name":"6.2.

De omzet steeg met 21% en kwam uit op €139 mln. Dit heeft het bedrijf vrijdag bekendgemaakt.\n\nIn de laatste drie maanden van het jaar profiteerde TomTom van een toegenomen productie van auto's. De kwartaalomzet van de divisie automotive kwam daardoor 64% hoger uit dan in hetzelfde kwartaal een jaar eerder. Als dit wordt gecorrigeerd voor wijzigingen in hoe TomTom de abonnementen op navigatiesoftware bijhoudt, bedraagt de toename 43%.\n\nOver het geheel 2022 nam de omzet van het concern toe van €507 mln naar €536 mln. ING-analist Marc Hesselink ging uit van een omzet van €520 mln. Voor 2023 gaat TomTom, dat zich steeds meer ontwikkelt tot softwarebedrijf, uit van een omzet van €540 mln tot €580 mln.\n\nIn een verklaring zegt ceo en medeoprichter Harold Goddijn dat TomTom in zijn afzet naar de autofabrikanten beter heeft gepresteerd dan de markttrend. Verder wijst hij erop dat TomTom een recordorderboek van €2,4 mrd heeft voor leveringen aan de autoindustrie.\n\nIn de verkoop van kaarten en locatietechnologie aan bedrijven buiten de auto-industrie (de zogeheten enterprisedivisie) voldeed TomTom volgens Goddijn aan zijn eigen prognoses. De omzet uit de verkoop van navigatiekastjes aan consumenten daalde over geheel 2022 verder, en wel met 11% naar €99,9 mln. De consumententak staat al enkele jaren onder druk door concurrentie van Google.\n\nJaarverlies\nHet concern leed over 2022 wel meer nettoverlies dan het jaar ervoor: een min van €102,7 mln tegen een verlies van €94,7 mln in 2021.\n\nIn de toekomst hoopt TomTom minder afhankelijk te worden van een eenmalige vergoeding per geïnstalleerd navigatiesysteem. Net als bij andere softwarebedrijven verschuift het verdienmodel ook in de autobranche naar doorlopende contracten.\n\nMedio december maakte het bedrijf bekend dat het gaat samenwerken met de Amerikaanse techbedrijven Microsoft, Amazon en Meta. Via een stichting zonder winstoogmerk, Overture Maps Foundation, gaan de bedrijven kaartdata ontwikkelen.\n\nHet idee is dat Overture als opensourceprogramma data levert voor een basiskaart. Bedrijven of andere instanties kunnen deze data op hun beurt gebruiken voor hun eigen kaart- of navigatieproducten. De alliantie hoopt dat de basiskaart van Overture op den duur als en wereldwijde standaard voor kaarten zal gaan gelden.\n\nLees het volledige artikel: https://fd.nl/bedrijfsleven/1466620/hogere-verkoop-aan-autoindustrie-stuwt-omzet-van-tomtom-jcb3caU4bQZS","urls_in_body":"https://fd.nl/bedrijfsleven/1466620/hogere-verkoop-aan-autoindustrie-stuwt-omzet-van-tomtom-jcb3caU4bQZS","created_at":"2023/02/03 08:18:47 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2121333466718209"},{"message_id":"1757870171881473","sender_name":"Mario Van den Broek","group_name":"6.2.

But who gets to work in tech, and who doesn’t? Without fair access to quality tech education, many people may never have the chance to contribute to building our shared future. That’s why we’re opening up tech ed opportunities at and beyond TomTom.\n\nBehind every great idea there’s an individual. But where was that individual before they sparked the breakthrough? How did they get there? And how did they turn that idea into a reality? Gaining access to the right education can make all the difference, opening a world of new opportunities.\n\nThe United Nations has recognized the fact that there are large gaps in access to education, leaving many people without an equal chance to contribute to the betterment of society. So, the U.N. set quality education as one of the Global Goals (aka the SDGs), seeking to help build a fair, equitable and inclusive future for all.\n\nAs a global technology company, we know that our impact reaches beyond our products and services. We’re motivated to help people from all backgrounds and gender identities make their impact in the world of tech. Not because it’s our responsibility, but because it’s exciting.\n\nWe are opening the doors to tech education and supporting career opportunities. How? By taking initiative both within our organization and through external partnerships.\n\nTech education at TomTom\nLearning never stops, and we have a host of initiatives to support all TomTom’ers in their continued growth. But when it comes to gaining access to tech education in the first place, we take different steps. Mainly, we focus on internships and our annual student hackathon, TomTom NEXT.\n\nThrough internships, we invite students from diverse backgrounds into an environment that helps them answer the big questions of what they want to do or achieve in their careers. Interns at TomTom get a chance to develop their skills and expand their knowledge through hands-on experience, while also seeing how their efforts are contributing to the world of mapmaking. Many interns stay at TomTom, and some use their experience to move on and achieve other things. Either way, access to tech education served as their springboard.\n\nThrough our annual global student hackathon, TomTom NEXT, we support and expand students’ education by giving them the chance to apply their knowledge and solve real-world challenges. While bridging the gap between theory and practice, the hackathon also incentivizes students to work in teams, collaborate and innovate alongside TomTom experts who provide support and mentorship throughout the event.\n\nStudents in Pune, India, participating in the second edition of the TomTom NEXT hackathon.\nStudents in Pune, India, participating in the second edition of the TomTom NEXT hackathon.\n\nPartnering with NGOs and educational institutions\nThrough partnerships, we bring tech education to those outside of TomTom, giving more people across the world access to tech education and career opportunities. Our two main partners for education include Codam Coding College in the Netherlands and Katalyst in India.\n\nCodam is a free coding school that teaches software engineering to people from all backgrounds and age groups, with no prior education or diploma needed. By working together, we’re able to connect with students who we wouldn’t otherwise meet, and give them the opportunity to jump right into professional experience at TomTom. We also have a Codam Fellows program, where TomTom’ers offer guidance and mentorship to Codam students, helping them build their professional goals and learn more about working in tech.\n\nKatalyst is an NGO that prepares young women from unprivileged backgrounds for leadership roles in the STEM field. Supporting 4,000+ students from a low-income background, Katalyst works with some 200 colleges to provide them with quality education. Through our partnership, over the span of four years TomTom will fund scholarships for seven women to support their engineering careers, while we continue empowering more women from Katalyst to pursue new opportunities in the world of tech. To help make a greater impact, every TomTom’er also has a paid time off benefit that they can use to volunteer at organizations like Katalyst.\n\nA little opportunity goes a long way\nFair, equitable and inclusive access to quality tech education is crucial to building a better future for all. From internships, to global student hackathons, to the right partnerships, it’s all about taking steps to help more people access the tech industry and contribute to shaping the world we all live in. Everyone plays a role. And who knows, maybe one of those people will have the idea that drives the next greatest technological breakthrough. https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/life-at-tomtom/how-tomtom-supports-inclusive-tech-education-for-all/","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/life-at-tomtom/how-tomtom-supports-inclusive-tech-education-for-all/","created_at":"2023/07/25 08:41:02 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2370678712524801"},{"message_id":"2972435511861249","sender_name":"Luis Ramos Pascua","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"Reimagining how maps are made: What's the latest for the TomTom Maps Platform?\nIt’s been about eight months since TomTom announced its ambitious goal of building the world’s smartest and most useful maps. Progress is being made, so it’s high time we got an update on how it’s all going. We spoke to Willem Strijbosch, VP of Product for Maps, to find out more.\n\nWhen TomTom announced its new platform last year, Michael Harrell, SVP Engineering at TomTom Maps, told us how the company is reimagining mapmaking to be more collaborative and more advanced, using masses of data, machine learning and AI.\n\nHe explained how the new TomTom Maps Platform and maps will galvanize TomTom’s success with current use cases while helping serve the booming and demanding industry of new location-based applications — ones that are poorly served by today’s digital mapping solutions.\n\nFor the full recap on what TomTom’s new Maps Platform is all about and why it could be so important, check out this article. For the latest on TomTom’s new platform, keep reading.\n\nThe progress\nTomTom’s not just making a new map, it’s redesigning and rebuilding the whole structure around it.\n\nHow it sources and shares map data, how it processes data and turns it into geospatial insights, how the platform can be used by developers to build new location-based tech and how customers can add their own data and style their maps are all being rethought.\n\nTomTom’s new Maps Platform builds map and location tech from many layers. These include a base map, private data, visualization, routing, traffic and POIs.\nWhen TomTom’s new platform is released, it will open the door for more location tech use cases and set a new standard for collaborative mapmaking, blending open data with high-value, proprietary geospatial tech, to map the world in real-time.\n\nWhile TomTom only announced its platform last year, it’s been years in the making.\n“Progress has been phenomenal,” Strijbosch says. “Moving to a new platform brings big technical risks, as any tech company will attest, and we’ve experienced that firsthand. However, we’re moving fast, and results from feasibility testing are very promising.”\nWith a big vision come big challenges\nIndeed, developing the platform hasn’t been easy. Strijbosch explains the developers working on TomTom’s ambitious real-time map have had to overcome many hurdles. Doing so is all part of the journey, but it’s also what makes building a new and game-changing technology so exciting.\n\n“It’s special to be in a position where you’re reimagining how maps are made,” he says. “Every step we take, we see that we’re getting closer to our vision.”\nEven though the vision is big and bold, it’s crystal clear. That clarity is proving to be crucial in rallying and energizing the organization and employees working on it. But just because it’s clear, doesn’t mean it’s easy.\nPutting it bluntly, TomTom is moving from map to maps. Or in other words, it’s evolving from being designed for a few use cases to a whole world of potential applications. Strijbosch says this is, “An enormous challenge that affects all parts of mapmaking.”\n\n“Typically, mapmakers provide access to a single proprietary map [hence the singular above] that needs to serve and work for all use cases. It’s like walking into a coffee shop and only being served espresso. It’ll work, but for a small number of people for some of the time. That’s not what customers want,” he adds. TomTom’s new Maps Platform offers more choice than that.\n\nIndeed, during its Capital Markets Day, TomTom’s Chief Revenue Officer, Mike Schoofs said the choice and opportunity TomTom’s new map offers will greatly increase the company’s addressable market. “We [TomTom] will gain market share and unlock new [business] segments.”\n\n“Today we play in half the market with existing segments, if you take all new segments, we get to play in more than 80% of the market,” he said.\n\nFor Strijbosch, the biggest challenge TomTom has had to overcome is designing and building the system so that it works across all these different uses cases, for many types of customers that build many types of technology.\n“One customer will want routing for two-wheelers, another will want it for passenger cars. The turns these two vehicles can make are different. One customer will want to store how much electricity their EVs are using on stretches of road, by model and year — to improve range calculations and efficiency. Another customer might want a map to embed in their social media app to help users find interesting places.” One map can’t possibly work for all these uses cases.\n\nTomTom’s new maps couldn’t come at a better time either. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an explosion in on-demand services, EVs, public transit options, location-based social media and an increase in two-wheeled transport and commuting. But overcoming this vast array of demands from the map(s), has led TomTom to design its platform from the ground up to fulfill all current customer needs while leaving the door open to satisfy new ones.\n\nThe data behind the map\nLast year, we spoke to a number of TomTom’ers about what’s going to power its new map platform. The short answer: super sources. The long answer: a massive tsunami-like wave of data from vehicles, open data sources, on-ground observations, proprietary and private data and more.\n\nThe flexibility to benefit from all these sources, and for customers to bring their own data and keep it safe and secure, is a core part of the platform. And it’s another key part of making a platform that works for all customers, not just a few. “All customers have broad and varying demands of the maps they use,” Strijbosch explains.\n\n“One customer will want to add their own feature data to the map that they cannot share with anyone else. However, another customer might simply want the best, most detailed map they can get. Both extremes can be catered for.”\n\nThink of a logistics firm putting all its warehouses on the map, complete with detailed entry points and loading bay layouts. Only the logistics firm need know this detail. For security reasons it’s best that the information is kept private too.\n\nThe most useful map then is one that can be tailored for each customer, their needs and their own data.\n\nLet’s look at what’s new on the map\nMaps are — among many things — data visualizations, which makes it easy to compare them. It’s easy to see from a map’s detail, features and geographical coverage, how useful it will be to you and how it stacks up against another map.\n\nIn today’s world, more and more demands are being placed upon maps. On-demand delivery companies expect details about building entry points and footprints, middle-mile logistics firms need exception routing and ride hailing apps need insight in to where they can and cannot pick riders up from. For TomTom, this means that the world’s most useful and smartest map must be the most universally detailed one.\n\nLook at the images below that compare TomTom’s current map (top line) to the map created by the new TomTom Maps Platform (bottom line), and you’ll see a few things.\n\nThe images above show comparisons between TomTom’s current map and the map generated by the new TomTom Maps Platform.\nAcross all examples above, you’ll see that road networks are very good. TomTom’s use cases have historically leant towards automotive and other road-based applications and the company has excelled at mapping these features.\nHowever, you’ll also see dramatic improvements in detail for parkland, footpaths, geological features, bike lanes, train lines and building locations. The kinds of things that are incredibly relevant to new on-demand delivery models, ride-hailing, two-wheeled transport, insurtech and more.\nAs Eric Bowman and Harold Goddijn (TomTom’s CTO and CEO, respectively) stated at TomTom’s Capital Markets Day, this increase in detail, coupled with the ability to blend the data each customer requires, is what will help TomTom cement its position in fast-growing markets like ride-hailing, on-demand local delivery, logistics and fleet management.\n\nConsider the example above for San Francisco, USA: the roadways, paths, access roads and the parkland’s geography itself are mapped in much more detail. This kind of map detail will be a huge benefit to fleet and logistics, or at-home delivery companies, who often must navigate the last 100 meters of a delivery, find building entry points and navigate complex areas.\n\nThose that rely on two-wheeled transport, or even pedestrians, stand to benefit too. A map this detailed, across such a broad range of features, packaged in an enterprise-ready format, is surely going to bolster current use cases and open the door to new location-based applications.\n\nWhat’s next?\nStrijbosch, and the wider team at TomTom, are rightly enthusiastic for what’s to come.\n“We’re at a very exciting moment for TomTom. There’s been overwhelmingly positive feedback and progress has been great so far. We can’t wait and will be thrilled to bring TomTom Maps Platform to a large audience,” he says.\nBut he’s also quick to stress that this is just the beginning. The TomTom Maps Platform is a living and breathing technology. As customers start using it and bring their own data, that further helps it grow and improve, with more improvements more uses for it will surely be found. The more we use it, the more its data can be honed, the stronger and more useful it will become. https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/the-latest-update-for-the-tomtom-maps-platform/","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/the-latest-update-for-the-tomtom-maps-platform/","created_at":"2023/07/25 08:51:16 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2370689018298369"},{"message_id":"2848935708803073","sender_name":"Cem Adiyaman","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"Het fiscale voordeel voor expats dreigt afgeschaft te worden.\n\nVorige maand lekte uit dat het kabinet de expatregeling als een mogelijke bezuinigingspost ziet om gaten in de begroting te dichten.\n\nHeadhunters, fiscalisten en werkgeversorganisaties waarschuwen dat dit negatief uitpakt voor de concurrentiepositie op de toch al krappe internationale arbeidsmarkt.\nTechbedrijven roepen in een open brief op tot behoud van de regeling.\nDe dreigende versobering of misschien zelfs afschaffing van de expatregeling zet een deel van het bedrijfsleven aan tot hardere actie, bovenop de lobby achter de schermen. Topbestuurders van 31 Nederlandse techbedrijven dringen in een vrijdag verstuurde open brief aan op behoud van de regeling, waardoor werknemers uit het buitenland over maximaal 30% van hun loon geen belasting hoeven te betalen.\nOnder de ondertekenaars bevinden zich onder anderen Peter Wennink van chipmachineproducent ASML, Jitse Groen van maaltijdbezorgdienst Just Eat Takeaway en Harold Goddijn van navigatiebedrijf TomTom. Werkgeverskoepels VNO-NCW en FME ondersteunen de oproep van de techbedrijven.\n\nStille diplomatie\nBedrijven en werkgeversorganisaties proberen al langer in stilte invloed uit te oefenen op de politiek om het fiscale voordeel in stand te houden. De kwestie kwam bijvoorbeeld aan de orde tijdens een kennismakingsgesprek dat techbedrijven voerden met de in januari aangetreden minister Micky Adriaansens van Economische Zaken.\nVorige maand lekte uit dat het kabinet de expatregeling als een mogelijke bezuinigingspost ziet om gaten in de begroting te dichten. Headhunters, fiscalisten en werkgeversorganisaties waarschuwden daarop in het FD dat een ingreep negatief uitpakt voor de concurrentiepositie van Nederland op de toch al krappe internationale arbeidsmarkt.\n\nDe open brief betekent niet dat de stille diplomatie volledig is uitgewerkt, meent Maurice Geraets, directeur Nederland van chipproducent NXP en mede-ondertekenaar. Volgende week bijvoorbeeld zal chipmachinefabrikant ASML nog de dialoog hierover aangaan in Den Haag, weet hij. 'Ik durf niet te zeggen dat de brief een laatste redmiddel is. Die heeft een versterkend effect. We zullen alle signalen afgeven.'\n\nTalent aantrekken\nDe zogeheten '30%-regeling' biedt compensatie voor extra kosten die expats maken, bijvoorbeeld voor huisvesting en bezoeken aan het land van herkomst. Dat maakt het makkelijker voor bedrijven om internationaal talent aan te trekken en draagt bij aan een aantrekkelijk vestigingsklimaat. Naast multinationals ASML en Booking.com maken ook start-ups en universiteiten er gebruik van. Dit jaar kost dat de schatkist naar verwachting circa €700 mln, afgelopen jaren was dat ongeveer €1 mrd.\nCritici die liever spreken van 'expatsubsidie' wijzen erop dat het fiscale voordeel een prijsopdrijvend effect heeft op de huizenmarkt. Vakbonden stellen dat Nederlands talent erdoor kan worden verdrongen op de arbeidsmarkt.\nDe ondertekenaars van de open brief noemen het aantrekken van buitenlands talent onontbeerlijk voor een goed innovatieklimaat. Tussen de 15% en 70% van hun hooggekwalificeerde medewerkers komt niet uit Nederland. 'Zonder kenniswerkers uit het buitenland worden wij minder concurrerend en kan Nederland haar innovatiepotentieel niet bereiken', schrijven zij.\nBij NXP, dat afgelopen jaar tweehonderd hooggeschoolde, dikwijls gepromoveerde medewerkers aannam, komen zo'n zeven op de tien nieuwe kenniswerkers uit het buitenland. 'Dat zijn mensen die kunnen kiezen tussen een baan in München, Londen, Parijs of Silicon Valley', vertelt Geraets.\nHij benadrukt dat in diverse andere Europese landen, waaronder bijvoorbeeld België en het Verenigd Koninkrijk, vergelijkbare faciliteiten zijn. Nederland zou zich uit de markt prijzen als de 30%-regeling wordt versoberd of afgeschaft, vreest Geraets. Het buitenlands toptalent extra salaris betalen, in geval van versobering van de fiscale faciliteit, noemt hij onwenselijk. Dat zou betekenen dat buitenlands talent meer (bruto) salaris zou krijgen dan de Nederlandse collega's die hetzelfde werk doen.\n\nLees het volledige artikel: https://fd.nl/politiek/1438932/open-brief-ceo-s-roept-op-tot-behoud-fiscaal-voordeel-expats-q1e2caHzUOWo","urls_in_body":"https://fd.nl/politiek/1438932/open-brief-ceo-s-roept-op-tot-behoud-fiscaal-voordeel-expats-q1e2caHzUOWo","created_at":"2022/05/28 14:40:09 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/1757879937425409"},{"message_id":"2882405832794113","sender_name":"Lorena Velo","group_name":"6.2.

As urban areas grow, so do their challenges: congestion, pollution, inefficiency, stress, and the broader issues of mobility, efficiency and sustainability. But it doesn’t have to be that way.\nWith advancements in technology, we have the opportunity to create the city of the future, where space is more accessible and designed to enhance quality of life, and where movement is seamless and adaptable. However, it’s us, the people, who must make conscious and concerted efforts to change our cities. We have the technology, the maps, the data, the understanding, but now it's time to put them into action. We need to start trying things, embracing trial and error: test, measure, react and test again. We must be bold in our decision-making.\n\nAs we at TomTom map the cities of the world our maps begin to show something beyond simply streets; we uncover possibilities. As a result, a vision of progress is emerging where transportation networks operate efficiently, roads respond dynamically to demand and data-driven insights uncover unexpected insights for urban planning.\n\nThis vision becomes the objective — to create cities that function in harmony with residents, businesses and visitors alike, instead of becoming massive car parks.\nNo longer are we left wondering what we must do to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion and make our cities more livable.\n\nFor the first time in history, we can make changes and see their impact immediately. The tools have never been better for making swift, impactful change backed by data that challenges our own biases and beliefs.\n\nhttps://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/explainers-and-insights/tomtom-s-city-of-the-future-a-vision-for-smarter-more-livable-urban-spaces/?utm_campaign=B2B_REG_NSL_MONTHLYNEWSROOM_GEN_202504&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_rAQEDta0xhlY0X5UodNxpeAejpkI8YrGOAL90Al6PkPcudcoIkh4DmzqIWuP3YXtQx1Q70RpZT-WR6NIHATeaQyEK9g&_hsmi=107042953&utm_source=hs_email","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/explainers-and-insights/tomtom-s-city-of-the-future-a-vision-for-smarter-more-livable-urban-spaces/?utm_campaign=B2B_REG_NSL_MONTHLYNEWSROOM_GEN_202504&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_rAQEDta0xhlY0X5UodNxpeAejpkI8YrGOAL90Al6PkPcudcoIkh4DmzqIWuP3YXtQx1Q70RpZT-WR6NIHATeaQyEK9g&_hsmi=107042953&utm_source=hs_email","created_at":"2025/04/06 18:32:22 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/3271445431762945"},{"message_id":"2962132655472641","sender_name":"Hans van Loenen","group_name":"6.2.

Anno 2023 bestaat het bedrijf nog steeds, maar die navigatieapparaten spelen lang niet meer zo'n grote rol als vroeger. Het bedrijf blijft echter nog steeds aan navigatiesoftware en kaarten werken. De directe verkoop aan consumenten speelt daarbij een steeds kleinere rol; andere bedrijven zoals autofabrikanten en app-ontwikkelaars zijn nu TomToms voornaamste klanten. Zo kan je als consument dus alsnog TomTom-producten gebruiken, ook als je de naam wellicht minder in beeld ziet dan voorheen.\nOm die kaarten- en navigatiediensten sneller, nauwkeuriger en gedetailleerder te kunnen maken, kondigde het bedrijf vorig jaar een nieuw kaartplatform en een samenwerkingsverband met bigtechbedrijven als Meta en Microsoft aan. Dat was voor Tweakers aanleiding om met het bedrijf te spreken over dat platform en het samenwerkingsverband, waarom ze bijzonder zijn en wat TomToms rol binnen de navigatiemarkt is. We spraken met Willem Strijbosch, VP of Product for Maps en daarbij verantwoordelijk voor de visie, strategie en doelen van TomToms kaarten.\n\nhttps://tweakers.net/reviews/10246/tomtom-slaat-een-nieuwe-weg-in-zelfrijdende-autos-en-openstreetmap.html","urls_in_body":"https://tweakers.net/reviews/10246/1/tomtom-slaat-een-nieuwe-weg-in-zelfrijdende-autos-en-openstreetmap-interview.html#reacties>, https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftweakers.net%2Freviews%2F10246%2Ftomtom-slaat-een-nieuwe-weg-in-zelfrijdende-autos-en-openstreetmap.html&display=page>, https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftweakers.net%2Freviews%2F10246%2Ftomtom-slaat-een-nieuwe-weg-in-zelfrijdende-autos-en-openstreetmap.html>, https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftweakers.net%2Freviews%2F10246%2Ftomtom-slaat-een-nieuwe-weg-in-zelfrijdende-autos-en-openstreetmap.html&text=TomTom%20slaat%20een%20nieuwe%20weg%20in%20-%20Zelfrijdende%20auto%27s%20en%20OpenStreetMap&lang=en&via=tweakers>, https://tweakers.net/reviews/10246/tomtom-slaat-een-nieuwe-weg-in-zelfrijdende-autos-en-openstreetmap.html","created_at":"2023/05/30 07:23:09 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2289425434402817"},{"message_id":"1824163760406529","sender_name":"Benoni Talahatu","group_name":"6.2.

Waar het navigatiebedrijf eerder nog dacht dat deze in 2023 met minstens 5% zou toenemen, is dit nu neerwaarts bijgesteld naar nulgroei. De omzetprognose voor volgend jaar bleef op €500 mln tot €550 mln staan.\n\nDat bleek vrijdag bij de publicatie van de cijfers over het derde kwartaal. De vrije kasstroom van TomTom TOM2€6,90-7,01% steeg in die periode tot €8 mln, tegen -€13,5 mln in het derde kwartaal vorig jaar. Ook over de hele eerste negen maanden is de kasstroom verbeterd, al was hij nog steeds negatief. TomTom heeft een nettocashpositie van €330 mln.\n\nDe omzet groeide afgelopen kwartaal met 7%, naar €136,3 mln, nadat in het tweede kwartaal al een kantelpunt was bereikt na een lange periode van krimp. 'We hebben een beter dan verwachte omzet geboekt in het derde kwartaal dankzij onze locatietechnologie', stelde topman Harold Goddijn in een persbericht.\n\nOok over de eerste negen maanden van het jaar zat de omzet in de lift. Die kwam met €391,8 mln 1% hoger uit dan in de eerste drie kwartalen van 2021. Het nettoverlies in het derde kwartaal bedroeg €17,5 mln. Vorig jaar was dat een verlies van €20,8 mln.\n\nIn de afgelopen drie maanden droeg de belangrijkste divisie Automotive, die onder druk lag door de chiptekorten bij autoproducenten, stevig bij. De omzet steeg daar met 29% tot €75 mln. Volgens Goddijn is er een belangrijke mijlpaal bereikt door een nieuw partnerschap met Hyundai. 'Alle auto's in Europa zullen worden uitgerust met onze kaarten- en verkeerssoftware.'\n\nOp 2 november houdt TomTom een Capital Markets Day om de strategie voor de komende jaren te onthullen. De werkwijze bij de kaartendivisie is de afgelopen tijd opgeschud en volgens Goddijn verregaand geautomatiseerd. Op de marktdag wordt uit de doeken gedaan wat dit betekent voor de dienstverlening aan de automobielindustrie en het bedrijfsleven.\n\nLees het volledige artikel: https://fd.nl/financiele-markten/1454724/tomtom-verlaagt-groeiprognose-kasstroom-in-2023-om-inflatie-jnj2caWR9elY","urls_in_body":"https://fd.nl/financiele-markten/1454724/tomtom-verlaagt-groeiprognose-kasstroom-in-2023-om-inflatie-jnj2caWR9elY","created_at":"2022/10/14 07:47:32 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/1958952238645249"},{"message_id":"1495420587687937","sender_name":"Mario Van den Broek","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"TomTom in consortium met Amerikaanse techreuzen voor delen cartografische data\n\nIn het kort\n- TomTom zet samen Met Microsoft, Amazon en Meta een stichting op voor de gezamenlijke ontwikkeling van kaartdata.\n- Bedrijven of andere instanties kunnen deze data op hun beurt gebruiken voor hun eigen kaart- of navigatieproducten.\n- Op termijn wil de alliantie meer bedrijven en instanties aantrekken voor opensourceprogramma Overture.\n\nKaartenmaker TomTom TOM2€6,78-1,45% gaat samenwerken met de Amerikaanse techbedrijven Microsoft, Amazon en Meta. Via een stichting zonder winstoogmerk, Overture Maps Foundation, gaan de bedrijven kaartdata ontwikkelen. Na de aankondiging steeg het aandeel TomTom zo'n 4% op de Amsterdamse beurs.\n\nHet navigatiebedrijf stelt dat de eisen aan kaarten steeds hoger worden als het gaat om nauwkeurigheid, volledigheid en actualiteit. ‘Het is ingewikkeld en duur voor een enkel bedrijf om een kaart te bouwen die toekomstbestendig is', zegt topman Harold Goddijn over de samenwerking. De bedrijven bundelen daarom de krachten.\n\nHet idee is dat Overture als opensourceprogramma data levert voor een basiskaart. Bedrijven of andere instanties kunnen deze data op hun beurt gebruiken voor hun eigen kaart- of navigatieproducten. De alliantie hoopt dat de basiskaart van Overture op den duur als en wereldwijde standaard voor kaarten zal gaan gelden.\n\nOverture komt onder beheer van een andere stichting, Linux Foundation (LF). Overture hanteert daarbij de regels die LF al voor opensourceprojecten gebruikt.\n\nLeidende rol\nDe betrokken bedrijven zullen Overture de komende tijd afbouwen. Daarbij neemt TomTom, als enige echte kaartenbouwer binnen de samenwerking, een leidende rol bij het bouwen van de basiskaart. ‘Wij zijn al een tijdje bezig met een kaartsysteem waar alle soorten informatie bij elkaar gebracht kan worden,’ aldus Goddijn. Het consortium verwacht dat Overture in de eerste helft van 2023 zal beginnen met het leveren van data.\n\nGoogle Maps\nTomTom en de techreuzen willen uiteindelijk meer partners verzamelen voor de alliantie. Ze denken daarbij onder andere aan dienstverleners en overheidsorganisaties. ‘Overheden bezitten al veel data die ze ter beschikking stellen aan het publiek. Met Overture als standaard kan die data verder verspreid worden,’ zegt Goddijn.\n\n‘Stel de overheid bouwt ergens een nieuwe wijk en wil dat dat terecht komt in de kaartenwereld dan kan dat met behulp van Overture’, legt de topman uit. ‘Maar dat kan ook bijvoorbeeld met visualisaties van demografische informatie of iets als elektriciteitsnetten’.\n\nOok concurrenten van TomTom, als Google Maps en Here, dat in handen is van diverse Duitse autofabrikanten, zijn welkom bij Overture. ‘De regels van de stichting voorzien erin dat ook zij op termijn deel kunnen nemen,’ aldus Goddijn.\n\nZakelijke markt\nTomTom werd groot met zijn eigen navigatiekastjes die automobilisten kunnen gebruiken om de weg te vinden. De afgelopen jaren is dit product echter ingehaald door kaartendiensten als Google Maps. Sindsdien richt TomTom zich met name op de zakelijke markt, waar het data en software levert aan autobedrijven, taxi-apps en pakketbezorgers. Meer dan 80% van de omzet komt uit die activiteiten.\n\nUiteindelijk wil TomTom de informatie die Overture ontwikkelt gaan combineren met eigen data en data van 'andere partijen' in een eigen product. Dit product kan het bedrijf vervolgens leveren aan bovengenoemde zakelijke klanten.\n\nTomTom worstelt met een dalende omzetcijfers en toenemende verliezen. In het derde kwartaal boekte TomTom een verlies van €17,5 mln. Afgelopen jaar namen de verliezen vooral toe als gevolg van een herstructureringslast in verband met een reorganisatie.\n\nWegens de doorgaande digitalisering in de sector schrapte TomTom in juni 500 banen, ruim 10% van het totaal. Door toepassing van nieuwe technologie voor het maken en updaten van kaarten zijn zij niet meer nodig, verklaarde de kaartenmaker.\n\nLees het volledige artikel: https://fd.nl/bedrijfsleven/1461373/tomtom-in-consortium-met-amerikaanse-techreuzen-voor-delen-cartografische-data-jpl2caU4bQZS","urls_in_body":"https://fd.nl/bedrijfsleven/1461373/tomtom-in-consortium-met-amerikaanse-techreuzen-voor-delen-cartografische-data-jpl2caU4bQZS","created_at":"2022/12/16 09:36:58 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2050384139354113"},{"message_id":"1757873779433473","sender_name":"Mario Van den Broek","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"What shipping containers can teach modern mapmaking\n\nRelevance: Tomtom recalls the revolution in the shipping industry in 1956, when a Californian businessman invented the standardized shipping container and allowed others to use it, royalty free. After 5 years, everyone was using it and shipping costs had dropped by 90%. Tomtom argues that the global mapmaking industry is now at a similar point, every party is doing their own thing and it is inefficient. As such, TomTom is, in collaboration with Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, presenting their own interoperable and open map data platform that they argue is the solution to this problem, Overture Maps Foundation.\n\nFeb 01, 2023\nBehind the map<https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/>\n\nToday, the world of global logistics would be nothing without the shipping container. The simple steel box revolutionized how goods are moved between continents and across oceans. Despite its simplicity, it's one of the most significant inventions ever — it also makes a great metaphor for the state of modern, global digital mapmaking.\n\nBack in December, on his blog Map Happenings<https://maphappenings.com/2022/12/01/why-geospatial-data-is-stuck-in-the-year-1955/>, James Killick — formerly of Etak, Apple and Esri, among others — made the case that the global mapmaking industry is stuck in the 1950s, in a time before shipping containers. And that the industry is in desperate need of its “shipping container moment.”\n\nIf TomTom’s recent announcements are anything to go by, that moment might not be far away.\n\nThe announcements: What's happening?\nAt the end of last year, TomTom announced<https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/press-releases/general/27841/tomtom-co-founds-overture-maps-foundation-to-build-open-map-data/> its role as a founding member in the Overture Foundation, an open-data project that’s aiming to build “reliable, easy-to-use and interoperable open map data.”\n\nThe Overture Foundation is aiming to standardize<https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-overture-maps-foundation-to-build-interoperable-open-map-data> key aspects of the location data and mapmaking industry to make working with location data a whole lot easier. At its core is an interoperable base map. Alongside this is a global entity reference system and a structured data schema. These aim to simplify interoperability by linking entities from different data sets to the same real-world entities and by defining and driving adoption of a common and documented data structure. Essentially, it ensures everyone knows what everyone else is talking about when they say or do something.\n\nAs Killick explains<https://maphappenings.com/2022/12/01/why-geospatial-data-is-stuck-in-the-year-1955/>, developers at location tech organizations must spend an inordinate amount of time (and money) making sense of location data, rather than building with it. They must:\n- Understand what’s contained within source data and how it’s organized.\n- Examine target systems and understand their data requirements.\n- Organize data for consistent output on various systems that all use different standards.\n- And finally, they must find a way of doing this repeatedly to keep maps up to date.\n\nWhy is location data locked away in proprietary platforms? Why is it so hard to add your own data? How can we unlock the massive amount of ideas on location data and location applications that never materialized? The industry has long left these questions unanswered.\n\n“It's all pretty horrible,” Killick says. But it doesn’t have to be — shipping containers might have the answer.\n\nHow the shipping container changed the world\nIn 1956, Malcolm McLean, a businessman from California, invented the standardized shipping container. As the owner of a trucking business, he knew the pains of transporting non-standard cargo, which could be sacks one day and wooden crates the next.\n\nWith McLean’s invention, cargo would be loaded into containers and then be transported and loaded on to standardized ships, using standardized machinery. Prices were standardized too. The shipping container made moving cargo a whole lot easier, but that was only part of its brilliance.\n\nMcLean made the patents on his invention available through a royalty-free lease to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Ship builders, port operators, logistics companies and anyone else interested could use the designs to make boats, trucks, equipment and tools that worked with containers. Soon, everyone was using shipping containers to move goods and the efficiency of global logistics went through the roof while the cost to move goods long distances tumbled.\n\nWhat does this have to do with global mapmaking and location tech?\nMost of what geolocation tech companies do is akin to loading and unloading non-standard cargo<https://www.sea.museum/2017/11/01/container> from their non-standard ships to non-standard ports. They must analyze every piece of cargo (think geospatial data). They must understand its destination, where and how it needs to be stored, manipulated and shared. They must make sure it fits in the system of their ship and that what comes out makes sense and isn’t lost or damaged along the way.\n\nEverybody felt that there must be a better way, where map data becomes more accessible and usable to all, breaking from its historical lock-in. What if there would be a common base map for the world, with a stable reference system that you can add your data on top of?\n\nThe Overture Foundation and TomTom’s new Maps Platform could be offering solutions to this problem.\n\nIf we see companies building with location data as cargo ships, then the Overture Foundation becomes the shipping container standard. In an abstract sense, Overture is standardizing how location data and digital maps can be transported and moved from system to system (or ship to ship). And importantly, it’s doing it like McLean did: in an open fashion that anyone can adopt or start working with.\n\nIn this metaphor, TomTom’s Maps Platform and Ecosystem become the tools that move shipping containers of data cargo between ports, ships and destinations. They organize them when they’re on the ship. It could even build the ships that cargo (data) moves on. Naturally, TomTom also ensures the cargo reaches its destination as intended, so its output remains valuable.\n\nThe shipping container has done more for globalization than all trade agreements of the past 50 years, combined, The Economist writes<https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero>. Countries that used shipping containers experienced three figure growth<https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero> in bilateral trade in the five years after they started using them and shipping costs dropped by up to 90 percent. Through standardization and interoperability, shipping got easier, and trade boomed.\nLocation tech developers could experience similar gains with Overture and TomTom Maps Platform. Engineers could skip the first 20 places on the game board if location data was interoperable and standardized. Innovation, like trade in the world of shipping containers, would bloom and flourish.\n\nIt’s early days for Overture and the new TomTom Maps Platform, but hopefully in decades to come, we’ll look back and see their launch as mapping’s “shipping container moment” and wonder how we ever managed.\n\nWhat shipping containers can teach modern mapmaking | TomTom Newsroom<https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/what-shipping-containers-can-teach-modern-mapmaking/>","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/>, https://maphappenings.com/2022/12/01/why-geospatial-data-is-stuck-in-the-year-1955/>,, https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/press-releases/general/27841/tomtom-co-founds-overture-maps-foundation-to-build-open-map-data/>, https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-overture-maps-foundation-to-build-interoperable-open-map-data>, https://maphappenings.com/2022/12/01/why-geospatial-data-is-stuck-in-the-year-1955/>,, https://www.sea.museum/2017/11/01/container>, https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero>., https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero>, https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/what-shipping-containers-can-teach-modern-mapmaking/>","created_at":"2023/02/02 10:45:18 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2120031400116225"},{"message_id":"2381126550421505","sender_name":"Bart Ladru","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"SXSW 2023: Making maps and location tech is really hard, but not if we do it together\n\n21-03-2023\n\nRelevance: TomTom's argument as to why one collective mapping platform (preferably TomTom's Overture Maps Foundation) should be the future of global mapmaking\n\nOn March 12, 2023, in Austin, Texas, mapping experts from the likes of Meta, Lyft and TomTom, working at the heart of this industry, gathered on the Industries Expo – Next Stage at SXSW to discuss the future of mapmaking and location-powered tech. If there’s anything we need to take away from this talk it’s that working with maps and location data is hard, whatever part of the industry you operate in. But it doesn’t need to be, if we work together.\n\nThere are two sides to working with location data: the software side and the data side, Marc Prioleau, Head of Location Partnerships at Meta, says. The software is the easier part, it’s the data that’s hard.\n\n“Maps are a digital representation of the physical world, and it has this annoying habit of changing; that’s problem one,” Prioleau says. “Problem two is, y’all want more and more out of your maps. 10 years ago, expectations were low, now your expectations are skyrocketing.”\n\nThere’s more nuance to it than that, though; creating or sourcing data is not the difficult part. There are sensors and people generating this data everywhere — cars, phones, roadside traffic monitors, user feedback, they all send data to inform the map. According to Mike Harrell, SVP Engineering Maps at TomTom, there’s “an incredible amount of data, a tsunami of data.” In fact, there are some 6 billion plus data points gathered every day.\n\nThe difficult part is taking that data and turning it into something useful and meaningful.\n\nMaps are globally pervasive\nOver the past few decades there’s been huge growth in location-aware tech. In the early days of digital maps, there was one core use case: turn-by-turn navigation. But now, maps and location tech are used in hundreds of commercial applications, including online dating, food delivery, ride hailing, shared mobility, motor insurance and fleet asset management. There are use cases for the common good that rely on accurate maps too, things like climate change monitoring, sea level rise monitoring, traffic management and urban planning.\n\nIn modern use cases, map data isn’t just about routing, it’s about being able to make smart decisions and provide useful insights. When the map is not good, those insights become close to useless.\n\n....\n\nThe challenge of building with map data\nThe challenge of building good location-based tech is not about having enough map data. The challenge is taking the mass of location data and turning it into something meaningful and useful.\n\nLocation data is everywhere, but it’s inconsistent, sometimes messy, comes in many different formats and is constantly changing, Harrell says. Similar sensor types that make similar observations might all communicate their data in different formats. They may all log the same place attribute, but they might all tag it in different ways and in reference to a different base map, even though it’s the same thing — creating five formats and five entries for the same real-world thing.\n\n“The industry has been stuck because of this. All devices, as they communicate their location information, they do it in a different way, to a different map. There’s no consolidated map that we all refer to,” Harrell says. “Your ability to innovate and advance in the space was held back because you were always trying to advance already solved problems.”\n\nCompanies and developers of location tech spend a lot of time, and money, resolving these kinds of differences and inconsistencies between geospatial data and base maps — so that they have a singular reference of truth. Everyone that builds with location data and wants to make apps like Lyft and Meta do, has to become a mapmaker to some degree. But, in a perfect world, that shouldn’t have to be the case. So, what do we do?\n“The world needs a better map,” Harrell says. The world needs a single record of truth about the world.\n\nImproving the world's map\nIf location-tech companies are all spending time solving the same problems over and over, that becomes a problem in itself. One which is inhibiting the development of features, service improvements and new location tech.\nBut it’s a problem that can be solved with an industry shift and refocus.\nToday, companies in the location-tech industry differentiate themselves mostly in the higher levels of map data. That’s to say the advanced proprietary data and services built on top of basic forms of map data. Even so, they still spend a lot of time ‘fixing’ low level data and their base maps to ensure their higher-level systems work. But that work doesn’t add value and in most cases is not a differentiating factor to other companies in their part of the industry.\n\nAll this could be solved if, at a very basic level, the location tech industry oriented itself around one point of reference, one map.\n\nThis is easier said than done. But what needs to be done is clear — there’s only one way the commercial world is going to solve the above problem and that’s if it works together to collectively agree on base level map data and standards to ensure location-tech systems works together from the ground up. This is where the Overture Foundation<https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/the-overture-foundation-and-its-tech/> comes in.\n\n“The collaboration (Overture Foundation<https://overturemaps.org/>) is to create a digital representation of the entire world of its most basic features, road network, POIs, building features and admin areas,” Harrell says. “If you create that base understanding, everyone else can communicate on that same base and interact and innovate.”\nOr as Prioleau says, “The map needs to be a common map.” The industry needs a new era of collaboration.\n\nWhat We Learned at SXSW 2023 | TomTom Newsroom<https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/sxsw-2023-what-did-we-learn/>","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/the-overture-foundation-and-its-tech/>, https://overturemaps.org/>), https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/behind-the-map/sxsw-2023-what-did-we-learn/>","created_at":"2023/04/13 09:03:16 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2221397300314113"},{"message_id":"2757627768823809","sender_name":"Bart Ladru","group_name":"6.2.

Over ten million automated vehicles (AV) sold by carmakers in North America and Europe are powered by TomTom’s advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) maps and software. This figure has doubled over the last year, growing more than twice as fast as the global market.\nTomTom expects its ADAS Map sales to continue growing\nTomTom now serves over 30 Automotive brands with its ADAS maps and software. Over one-third of all new AVs that hit the road are equipped with an ADAS map supported by TomTom.\n\n“Today, we power over ten million automated vehicles on the road with our ADAS maps, winning overall market share in the AV solutions market,” said Mike Schoofs, Chief Revenue Officer, TomTom. \"We have consistently outperformed the already strong growth in the market, which is proof of the quality and robustness of our ADAS solutions.\"\n\nThe TomTom ADAS Map provides advanced driver assistance systems with high-quality road information globally, including gradient, lanes, curvature, signs, and speed limits, enabling vehicles to better anticipate the road ahead, improving driver safety, comfort, and vehicle efficiency.\n\nIncreased ADAS uptake driven by heightened safety requirements\nRecent EU legislation has made intelligent speed assistance (ISA) mandatory for all new vehicle types since July 2022, and mandatory for all new vehicles from July 2024. ISA can use cameras alone to identify speed limits through traffic sign recognition, however, these have limited range and can be obstructed by rain or snow. This makes it difficult for cars to identify and display conditional and variable speed limits, such as speed limits for specific weather conditions or vehicle types. Combining camera input with TomTom's ADAS map data solves these issues. TomTom’s map data fuses with the vehicle’s ADAS functions to prepare for changing speed limits resulting in greater vehicle safety and efficiency.\n\nEuroNCAP's latest Speed Assist System (SAS) protocol has even higher safety standards than the ISA regulation, awarding vehicles with comprehensive maps and connected service content with higher safety ratings. TomTom’s ADAS services can support the 2023 SAS protocol. This includes all conditional speed limits and a wide range of warnings about local hazards, such as accidents ahead, and road features, like road curvatures. To keep up with heightened safety requirements, carmakers increasingly demand technology that achieves the highest level of safety.\n\n\"Maps are essential in achieving the level of accuracy that current and future regulation requires and will be central to the future of ADAS and AV applications,” Yu Guo, VP Software Engineering, said. \"As an industry leader in mapping, we are well positioned to support carmakers’, having the most complete assisted and automated driving mapping portfolio in the industry.\"\n\nTomTom’s ISA solution, Virtual Horizon, is used by carmakers globally to be ISA compliant. TomTom's Virtual Horizon is the only all-in-one solution from a single supplier that helps carmakers meet ISA-type approval requirements, covering both the data and a software suite to display the data.\n\n\"We have proven to be a reliable partner for carmakers by providing a complete automated driving mapping portfolio that ensures the safest driving experience for drivers,\" Schoofs added. \"With take rates for ADAS forecast to rise, we expect to keep up this momentum over the coming years, cementing TomTom’s leading position in this market.\"\n\nTomTom powers over 10 million vehicles with automated driving solutions | TomTom Newsroom<https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/press-releases/general/282331213/tomtom-powers-over-10-million-vehicles-with-automated-driving-solutions/>\n\n#automotive","urls_in_body":"https://www.tomtom.com/>, https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/press-releases/general/282331213/tomtom-powers-over-10-million-vehicles-with-automated-driving-solutions/>","created_at":"2023/04/13 09:06:48 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2221400841715713"},{"message_id":"2096716137562113","sender_name":"Bart Ladru","group_name":"6.2.

This emerged on Friday from a report by analyst Wim Gille (CFO and Head of Equity Research at ABN AMRO).\n\nThe analyst attributes the price target reduction to lower profitability and higher capital costs.\n\nTomTom's choice of OpenStreetMap, as presented during the last investor day, will result in lower costs for making the maps while increasing quality, Gille said. \"This made the company finally able to compete well in the corporate fleet management segment,\" believes Gille, who speaks of \"a smart move.\"\n\nGille thinks automotive will provide growth in the coming years, as car production will increase and TomTom will gain market share. The analyst also points to TomTom's \"healthy order book\". It contains sales for as much as 10 years, looking at current sales. In Gille's view, the order book is also a guarantee of more market share.\n\nThe enterprise market is twice as big as the automotive market, according to Gille, but TomTom's revenue from the latter is still the largest. That is because the enterprise market is more competitive and fragmented, but most important, according to the analyst, is that the maps do not meet developers' requirements. That is why TomTom has only a 9 percent market share. But this should increase with the new model.","urls_in_body":"","created_at":"2022/12/13 15:05:10 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2046365862625281"},{"message_id":"1772183113367553","sender_name":"Marlene Jans","group_name":"6.2.

TomTom","body":"Mercedes krijgt navigatie van Google Maps en dat is slecht nieuws voor Here Technologies\nFrom FD - Achmed Majid\n\nMercedes-Benz has announced that motorists will still be able to use Google Maps in new models this year.\nThe navigation system of Netherlands-based Here Technologies will thus be bypassed.\nThis is notable because Mercedes once co-owned Here Technologies precisely to keep Google out.\n\nThe cooperation with Google Maps, which Mercedes announced as part of a new software strategy, is a hard sell for Here Technologies. This company, headquartered in Amsterdam and with a technology division in Eindhoven, is owned by Mercedes, but is thus being bypassed by the Stuttgart-based company. 'This could mean the end for Here's major role in the German auto industry,' said independent automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt.\n\nIn 2015, a consortium consisting of Daimler (Mercedes' parent company), Audi and BMW acquired the company from Nokia for €2.8 bln, precisely with the aim of holding a strong alternative to Google. Here is one of the largest suppliers for built-in navigation in cars, bigger even than TomTom.\n\nIt was long assumed that automakers would be reluctant to partner with Google because it would cause them to lose control of the cars' data, but that time seems to be over. Symbolic of that shift is the move by Dutchman Jorgen Behrens. He traded a job as vice president of Here Technologies last year for that position at Google's car navigation arm.\n\nDifferent direction\nMercedes and Google did not report financial details about their partnership, but German business newspaper Handelsblatt states, based on insiders, that the automaker will transfer tens of millions annually to Google for licensing its services.\n\nGoogle's navigation is part of the new software system MB.OS that Mercedes has launched. By the end of 2024, this system should be offered in the first new model series. Handelsblatt writes that Mercedes will invest up to €2 bln a year in this software.\n\nMercedes' ceo, Ola Källenius, would say little to journalists during the announcement of the deal about what role Here will still play for the automaker, but only let it be known that he \"wants to go further\" with Google. A spokesperson in the Netherlands reported that Here will continue to cooperate with Mercedes on certain parts in the future, and that the current collaborations will \"continue for the time being. Some car models will continue to use Here's software.\n\nCariad\nAccording to analyst Schmidt, automakers now think they would be better off buying some parts of the software from California tech companies rather than trying to invent the wheel themselves. As an example, he cites Volkswagen's software project called Cariad. That experienced significant delays and ran up a hefty cost. It was one of the main reasons for Herbert Diess' departure as ceo.\n\nSo the fact that Mercedes is now putting its money where its mouth is seems logical to Schmidt. The automakers Polestar, Volvo and Renault previously opted for a full operating system of Google's Android in their electric cars, which includes Google Maps.\n\nBut Mercedes is the first automaker to implement Google Maps in its own software system. According to Källenius, even with Google's arrival, all data remains in Mercedes' hands. \"It is our house, we make the rules and we make the decisions,\" the ceo said.\n\nIncidentally, the navigation system is not the only thing that will be found in Mercedes' cars. Drivers will also be able to play YouTube videos. But that Google app can only be used in parking mode or during highly automated driving on highways.","urls_in_body":"","created_at":"2023/02/24 10:30:33 +0000","client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/rsmnl.nl/messages/2151906686976001"},{"message_id":"1569226825392129","sender_name":"Mark van der Ploeg","group_name":"6.2.

Foto: Harold Versteeg/ANP\nTomTom, de Amsterdamse bouwer van navigatiesoftware, verwacht dat de omzet dit jaar daalt door aanhoudende problemen op de automarkt. De omzet zal uitkomen tussen de €505 mln en €565 mln, een stuk lager dan analisten gemiddeld hadden ingeschat. Dat meldt het bedrijf dinsdag bij de publicatie van de cijfers over het vierde kwartaal van 2024.\n\nHet aandeel TomTom gaat dinsdag op de Amsterdamse beurs hard onderuit. Halverwege de ochtend levert het aandeel meer dan 14% in.\n\nIn de zomer trok TomTom de eerder afgegeven verwachtingen voor 2025 in. De autoverkopen zitten wereldwijd in een dip, en eerder aangekondigde nieuwe modellen worden uitgesteld. Dat betekent dat er ook minder vraag is naar de ingebouwde kaarten van TomTom. De nieuwe verwachting die dinsdag met de jaarcijfers over 2024 werd gegeven blijkt somberder dan door beleggers was geanticipeerd.\n\nTomTom had niet alleen maar slecht nieuws. Het bedrijf verkoopt ook digitale kaarten aan softwarebedrijven als Microsoft, en die divisie groeit in omzet– in 2024 met 9% naar €161 mln. Dat kan de problemen bij de veel grotere automotive-tak echter niet compenseren.\nIn 2024 kwam de totale omzet 2% lager uit dan een jaar eerder, op €574 mln. Er werd een nettoverlies van €17,3 mln geleden, iets minder dan de €21 mln van 2023. De vrije kasstroom daalde met €4 mln.\n\nDie kasstroom is volgens ING-analist Marc Hesselink nog de grootste rode vlag. Voor 2025 verwacht TomTom dat de kasstroom stabiliseert. ‘Een nogal negatieve verrassing’, schrijft Hesselink in zijn analyse van de cijfers. ‘Want de kasstroom was mogelijk de belangrijkste overblijvende reden om in TomTom te investeren.’\n\nTaco Titulaer, de cfo van TomTom, spreekt in het persbericht over kostenbesparingen: ‘(….) we zullen ons richten op initiatieven om onze product roadmap te blijven uitvoeren en kostenefficiëntie te stimuleren. Onze sterke cashpositie stelt ons in staat om te investeren en commerciële kansen te benutten.

Dit stelde analiste Nigel van Putten van zakenbank Kempen donderdag.\n\nDe negatieve vrije kasstroom van 26,8 miljoen euro betekent een negatieve marge van 18 procent volgens de definitie die het bedrijf hanteert. Voor heel dit jaar rekent TomTom op een negatieve marge van circa 5 procent. En dat belooft volgens Van Putten dus nog lastig te worden.\n\nHoewel de operationele omzet van 68 miljoen euro voor automotive in het kwartaal 5 miljoen euro beter is dan Kempen had voorzien, betekent dit nog steeds een afname van 8 procent ten opzichte van het eerste kwartaal van 2021. Ook hier wordt de doelstelling van een groei van 15 procent in 2022 dus niet eenvoudig, meent de analist.\nVooralsnog handhaaft TomTom de outlook voor 2022, al maakte het wel opmerkingen over de toegenomen onzekerheid. De taxaties van Kempen zijn lager dan de outlook en Van Putten ziet geen reden om hier iets aan te doen. \"Onze taxaties weerspiegelen de lastige marktomstandigheden\", meent hij.

Maar de groei in het derde kwartaal was lager dan in het vorige kwartaal en bleef ook enigszins achter bij de verwachtingen van analisten. De koers van het aandeel daalde direct na opening van de beurs en staat rond 14.30 uur 7% lager.\n\nNet als in de eerdere kwartalen van dit jaar profiteert het bedrijf van het herstel van de auto-industrie, waardoor de omzet in navigatieproducten snel steeg. Het bedrijf stelt bovendien nog wat harder te groeien dan de volumes in de auto-industrie, dus marktaandeel te winnen.\n\nDe omzet nam in het derde kwartaal van dit jaar met 6% toe tot €144,1 mln. Dat is lager dan de €146,5 mln waar analisten volgens persbureau Bloomberg vanuit gingen.\nDe voor TomTom belangrijkste divisie automotive, die navigatieproducten levert aan de automobielindustrie, kwam uit op een omzet van € 82,2 mln, 32% meer dan in het vergelijkbare kwartaal vorig jaar. Vorig kwartaal groeide de omzet van deze divisie nog met 52%.\n\nIn het tweede kwartaal waren er in deze divisie wel eenmalige meevallers die de omzet stuwden.

De groei viel tegen en Harold Goddijn moest de outlook voor dit jaar alweer verlagen, omdat de automotive markt het moeilijk heeft door het tekort aan chips.\n\nIn ons webinar over het beleggingselftal gaven we al aan in TomTom een potentiele veldspeler te zien, maar ook dat we afwachtten of het aandeel eerst niet richting €6 gaat. Dat is inmiddels gebeurd.\n\nDe reden daarvoor is dus bekend, tekorten bij autofabrikanten waardoor minder auto’s uitgeleverd kunnen worden. Wie momenteel een nieuwe auto koopt, krijgt de tweede sleutel pas een half jaar later, zo erg is het. Dat merkt TomTom ook, er wordt minder uitgeleverd en dus minder omzet voor de kaartenspecialist.\n\nBeleggers moesten lange tijd wachten op groei bij TomTom, dat leek er eindelijk aan te komen maar in het zicht van de haven strandde het bedrijf dus. Weer, de teleurstelling bij TomTom, dat op cijfers regelmatig daalt, houdt nog niet op.\n\nKosten hoger\nOok de kosten liepen op. Omdat een klant met de productie van een bepaald type auto begint, moet TomTom de aan die klant toegewezen kosten opvoeren in de winst- en verliesrekening. Dat haalt de marge omlaag van 86% naar 77%.\nDoor allerlei redenen moet TomTom de outlook voor dit jaar naar beneden bijstellen.

TomTom","body":"Proposal Tax Compliance US30 entity\nMario and I had a call with TomTom and Eric Perez to discuss the 75K a year proposal for Tax Compliance with TomTom. An important note is that TomTom is changing from their current service provider because they have experienced lots of stress for filling the tax returns even though the information was provided timely and correctly, an example is that they had to file on the last day, which was a saturday and is not a nice way to spend the weekend. This is important for us to know and to comfort the client that we will indeed respect timelines and be very conscious about this. See meeting notes below:\n\nIntroduction Eric Perez:\nEric has extensive experience with RSM, having been with the company for 23 years and previously with Deloitte.\n- He specializes in working with international clients and has collaborated with Mario on several projects.\n- Eric possesses excellent communication skills and is instrumental in breaking down U.S. taxation concepts.\n- Eric serves as the single point of contact, with a team of experts behind the scenes covering various states and areas.\n\nTax Return Filing:\n- Eric prefers to file tax returns three to four months ahead of time, provided that the necessary information is available.\n- He typically initiates the process within 30 days of finalized trial balances.\n- The processing timeline usually spans around 60 days, starting with federal taxes and then addressing state taxes.\n\nR&D Credits:\n- We discussed eligibility for R&D credits at both the national and state levels in the U.S., as well as R&D reliefs and incentives.\n- Eric emphasized that the availability of R&D credits depends on the contract and the specific R&D credit requirements.\n\nTransfer Process:\n- The transfer process is generally seamless but involves a formal request to TomTom for consent of their Tax Information release to RSM US.\n- This process may take a few weeks and is a common industry practice.\n\nOpen Items:\n- We touched upon older open items, such as the utilization of NOL (Net Operating Loss) and the need to monitor this closely.\n\nIncome Tax Provision:\n- TomTom handles the income tax provision internally, based on IFRS books, and it's managed by tax accountants.\n\nNew State Laws:\n- RSM US will keep TomTom updated on new state laws, especially as TomTom expands into a new state.\n\nTimelines and Communication:\n- We discussed the importance of respecting timelines and maintaining effective communication throughout the process.\n- Both parties emphasized the need to avoid working closely to deadlines, which can be stressful.\n\nERP Change in January 2024:\n- Leonie highlighted the upcoming ERP change in January 2024 and the importance of mapping the old and new systems for a smoother transition.\n\nAction Items:\n- Eric will send confirmation of the scope and the fee for our engagement.\n- We will provide more information about RSM US in terms of size and coverage.\n- Eric will share additional details regarding his national and local work with us.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNext week we will have a call with RSM Mexico and TomTom to also discuss that proposal.

Status Update\n- Poland reporting is nearly complete; only the CIT (Corporate Income Tax) needs revision.\n- The audit has been finalized and the FS has been signed\n- Poland’s JPK (Standard Audit File for Tax) still needs to be tackled for 2025 reporting readiness.\n\n2. JPK Preparation Plan\n- Urgency: JPK files must be ready by end of 2025 for March 2026 filing.\n- Challenges:\n- Systems are not ready to generate JPK directly.\n- Multi-source data requires external tool integration.\n- Books are not in Polish, which is a technical non-compliance.\n- Solution:\n- Piotr (RSM Poland)will send an Excel template with required data columns.\n- TomTom returns a sample month’s data.\n- A back-test will confirm data formatting and system readiness.\n\n3. IFRS vs Local GAAP\n- Discussed possible switch to IFRS reporting in Poland to simplify JPK obligations.\n- TomTom may qualify; suggestion to consult auditors regarding IFRS eligibility for 2025.\n\n4. Fee Structure\n- System analysis & mapping: Time & materials based.\n- Estimated 50–200 hours, depending on IT team efficiency.\n- Reporting & filing: Fixed fee.\n- License fee: ~€700/year\n- Workload depends on frequency (annual = 2–3 hours/year, monthly = ×12)\n- Cost increases with more frequent reporting.\n\n5. Data Structure & Chart of Accounts\n- No major account structure changes expected after migration to S/4HANA in 2024.\n- Additions of accounts happen but structure remains stable.\n- Creditors and debtors are posted to single accounts with sub-ledger identification.\n\n6. E-Invoicing (KSeF)\n- Starts in February 2026 for TomTom, April 2026 for smaller companies.\n- Invoices must go through the Ministry of Finance’s portal, with real-time validation.\n- E-invoice numbers must link to CIT JPK filings.\n- Strong recommendation to coordinate with Avalara (existing tool) and internal VAT team.\n\n7. Fixed Assets Reporting (2026)\n- Reporting will cover assets purchased from Jan 1, 2025.\n- Assets (laptops, vehicles, etc.) are tracked in SAP S/4HANA.\n- No expected issues if data is available in system; some IT work will be needed.\n\nNext Steps\n1. Piotr (RSM Poland) to send Excel template with JPK requirements.\n2. TomTom to submit one month’s sample data for testing.\n3. Piotr (RSM Poland) to provide a step plan and fee quote based on results.\n4. Discussion with auditors on switch to IFRS.\n5.
